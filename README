Workout application
==========================================================================

This is a workout management app, where a user can track his progress 
at their gyms. It will be designed to register gyms, machines, exercises 
and the weight and progress that individual users make. Typical use cases 
are:

- Add exercise
- Add workout performance
- Track increase in workout level
- Get hints what workouts have not been done for a long period of time
- Compare progress with friends

Users log in through Facebook or Google. Data is stored in a centralized
PostgreSQL database. Play and Scala are used for platform and language.
Squeryl is the Scala ORM. The app is developed with deployment to Heroku
in mind, but can be deployed and run anywhere with a PostgreSQL database
without modifications (other than configuration).
